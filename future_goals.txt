1. Core Architecture Overview
Frontend:

React (with Vite or Next.js for SSR if needed)
Tailwind CSS for UI
Chart.js, React-Chartjs-2 for visualizations
State management: React Context/Redux/React Query
Backend:

Node.js/Express or Python (FastAPI) for custom APIs
Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage + Edge Functions)
AI/ML: OpenAI API, HuggingFace, or custom models (deployed via serverless functions or cloud)
LaTeX microservice (for PDF resume generation)
Integration with third-party APIs (LinkedIn, job boards, college LMS, etc.)
Other:

Notification system (email, in-app, push)
OAuth (Google, LinkedIn, College SSO)
CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Vercel, Netlify, Railway, etc.)
2. Feature-by-Feature Steps
A. AI Career Path Navigator
Steps:

Design a user profile schema (interests, skills, goals, education, etc.).
Build a UI for students to input/update their aspirations.
Integrate with a career-path AI model (OpenAI, custom, or third-party).
Visualize career paths using a graph/tree (D3.js, React Flow).
Suggest skills/courses dynamically (fetch from MOOCs, college DB, etc.).
B. AI Internship & Project Matchmaking
Steps:

Build a backend to ingest internship/project data (from companies, college, etc.).
Enhance student profiles with project preferences.
Use AI to match students to opportunities (vector similarity, NLP).
UI: Show matches, allow students to apply, and track status.
C. Smart Application Tracker with Outcome Prediction
Steps:

Design a job application tracking schema (status, dates, feedback, etc.).
Build a dashboard for students to log and view applications.
Train or fine-tune a model to predict outcomes (based on resume, job, history).
Suggest next actions (follow-up, skill up, network) using AI.
D. AI Resume & Portfolio Builder (with LaTeX)
Steps:

Build a resume builder UI (drag-and-drop, templates, LaTeX editor).
Integrate a LaTeX-to-PDF microservice (Node.js or Python, Dockerized).
Use AI to suggest improvements, generate cover letters, and tailor resumes.
Allow export to PDF, web, LinkedIn.
E. AI Assignment & Learning Assistant
Steps:

Integrate with college LMS or allow manual assignment entry.
Build a calendar/timeline UI for deadlines.
Use AI to generate study plans, reminders, and practice questions.
Suggest resources (YouTube, MOOCs, notes) using AI search.
F. AI Networking & Mentorship Engine
Steps:

Build a database of alumni, mentors, and students.
Use AI to match students with mentors based on goals, skills, and interests.
Generate personalized outreach messages (cold emails, LinkedIn).
Track mentorship sessions and feedback.
G. Automated Skill Gap Analyzer & Microlearning
Steps:

Parse job descriptions and student profiles using NLP.
Identify missing skills and recommend micro-courses.
Integrate with learning platforms (Coursera, Udemy, etc.).
Track progress and update recommendations.
H. AI Interview Coach
Steps:

Build a mock interview UI (text and video).
Use AI to generate questions and analyze answers (sentiment, content, delivery).
Provide feedback and improvement tips.
Track progress over time.
I. Real-Time Job Market Insights Dashboard
Steps:

Aggregate job market data (APIs, web scraping, college placement data).
Use AI to analyze trends and personalize insights.
Visualize with charts and graphs.
Alert students to new opportunities and trends.
J. AI-Powered Mental Health & Productivity Assistant
Steps:

Allow students to log mood, stress, and productivity (optionally passive tracking).
Use AI to detect burnout patterns and suggest wellness resources.
Integrate with calendar for break reminders and productivity tips.
3. General Steps for Each Feature
Research & Design:

Interview students, placement officers, and alumni for pain points.
Design wireframes and user flows.
MVP Build:

Start with core functionality for each feature.
Use third-party APIs and pre-trained models where possible.
AI Integration:

Use OpenAI, HuggingFace, or custom models for NLP, recommendations, and predictions.
Build microservices for heavy AI tasks (resume parsing, interview analysis, etc.).
Testing & Feedback:

Beta test with real students and iterate based on feedback.
Scale & Polish:

Optimize for performance, security, and accessibility.
Add analytics and admin dashboards for colleges.
4. Unique Differentiators
Hyper-personalized, AI-driven guidance (not just static tools).
Deep integration with college systems and real-world opportunities.
Focus on holistic student growth: career, learning, networking, and well-being.
Modular platform: colleges can pick and choose features.
