"Create a 3 to 4 slide PowerPoint presentation explaining the job matching score calculation used in a job matching system. The presentation should cover the following main points:  Introduction:  Purpose of the job matching score: to evaluate how well a job matches a user's profile. Overview of the scoring function implemented in PostgreSQL. Validation:  Ensures exactly one user profile and one job record exist before calculation. Components of the Score:  Job Title Matching: similarity between user's job titles and job title, with dynamic weighting. Skills Matching: Required skills: compares user's skills and proficiency against job's required skills. Nice-to-have skills: adds bonus points for matching additional skills. Experience Matching: compares user's experience years with job's required experience level, applying penalties for gaps. Industry Matching: similarity between user's industry and job's industry. Location/Work Type Matching: considers remote work preferences and geographic proximity. Scoring and Output:  Weighted combination of all components to calculate an overall score. Scores are rounded and categorized into match levels: Perfect, Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor. The function returns a JSON object with detailed scores and match category. Use clear bullet points, concise explanations, and include any relevant visuals or diagrams to illustrate the scoring components and their weights. The presentation should be suitable for a technical audience familiar with job matching systems."
